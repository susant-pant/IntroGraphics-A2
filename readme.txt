W: Greyscale L = 0.333R + 0.333G + 0.333B
E: Greyscale L = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B
R: Greyscale L = 0.213R + 0.715G + 0.072B. This Greyscale looks the best because it has the most Green, which is the colour that the human eye is most sensitive to. Also, the Blue used here is closest to the actual value of Blue.

Notes:
1. My personal favourite is Schizoid Album Cover with the Grunge Black and White Effect, the Red Hue set to Max, and the 7x7 Gaussian Blur.

2. You can use any combination of Hue Modifiers at once. E.G. you can change R, G, and B at the same time, or any other combination.

3. Image position, orientation, zoom, colour effects, and blur/edge effects stay the same while changing pictures.
